# Rock Paper Scissors

## 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors Game (JavaScript)

- Randomized computer choices.
- Automatic score tracking for both the player and the computer.
- Final winner is announced after **5 rounds**.

### 🚀 How to Play:
1. Run the script in a browser (linked to an HTML file) or in a Node.js environment.
2. Enter **"rock"**, **"paper"**, or **"scissors"** when prompted.
3. The game announces the round winner and updates the score.
4. After 5 rounds, the final winner is determined.
